# ezo-app


My friend asked me to write simple program for working with tarot cards. Let's go.


## Let's delve into Tarot Cards! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”®ðŸ’…
Tarot cards are a deck of 78 cards that have been used for centuries for divination, self-reflection, and personal growth. Each card in the deck has its own unique symbolism and meaning, and when drawn and interpreted, can provide insight into one's life, relationships, and future.

Let's go full ezo mode!


# How I created this app

## Initialize a new Next.js project

Open your terminal and navigate to your project's directory, then run the following command:

```
npx create-next-app@latest simple-nextjs-app
```



### Install necessary dependencies

Although for this simple app, Next.js and React are the only dependencies, it's good practice to install any other you might need:

```
Copy code
```
