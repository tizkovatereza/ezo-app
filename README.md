# ezo-app


My friend asked me to write simple program for working with tarot cards. Let's go.



# How I created this app

## Initialize a new Next.js project

Open your terminal and navigate to your project's directory, then run the following command:

```
npx create-next-app@latest simple-nextjs-app
```



### Install necessary dependencies

Although for this simple app, Next.js and React are the only dependencies, it's good practice to install any other you might need:

bash
Copy code
npm install
